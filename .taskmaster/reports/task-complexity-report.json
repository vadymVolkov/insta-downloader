			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Install and Configure FFmpeg Dependencies",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the FFmpeg installation and configuration task into subtasks covering: 1) System dependency installation for different OS platforms, 2) Python library integration, 3) Verification utility implementation, and 4) Documentation and error handling.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves cross-platform system dependency installation and Python library integration. While conceptually straightforward, it requires handling multiple operating systems and potential installation issues. The verification function is already well-defined, but needs proper implementation and error handling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Create Audio Directory Structure",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the audio directory structure task into subtasks covering: 1) Directory creation and permission setup, 2) FastAPI static file serving configuration, and 3) Path/URL utility functions implementation.",
			"reasoning": "This is a relatively simple task with clear requirements. The implementation details are already well-defined with code examples. The main complexity comes from ensuring proper permissions and integrating with the existing FastAPI application structure."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 16,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Audio Extraction Utility",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the audio extraction utility implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Core FFmpeg extraction function, 2) Error handling and logging, 3) Performance optimization, 4) Format compatibility testing, and 5) Integration with existing file structure.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves working with external processes and media conversion, which introduces complexity. While the core function is provided, proper error handling for various failure scenarios, performance considerations, and format compatibility testing are needed. The integration with the existing system adds another layer of complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 17,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Audio File Cleanup Mechanism",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the audio file cleanup mechanism into subtasks covering: 1) File discovery and sorting logic, 2) Safe file deletion implementation, 3) Error handling and logging, and 4) Integration with the extraction workflow.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves file system operations with potential for errors (permissions, concurrent access). The cleanup logic needs to be robust against various edge cases and failure scenarios. While the core algorithm is straightforward, proper implementation requires careful error handling and integration with the existing system."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 18,
			"taskTitle": "Update Download Service for Instagram",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Instagram download service update into subtasks covering: 1) Existing service analysis and integration points, 2) Audio extraction integration, 3) Response schema updates, and 4) Error handling for extraction failures.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires understanding and modifying existing code while maintaining backward compatibility. The integration needs to handle various error scenarios gracefully. The complexity comes from ensuring the audio extraction doesn't negatively impact the existing video download functionality and properly handling all edge cases."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 19,
			"taskTitle": "Update Download Service for TikTok",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the TikTok download service update into subtasks covering: 1) Existing service analysis and integration points, 2) Audio extraction integration with TikTok-specific considerations, 3) Response schema updates, and 4) Error handling for extraction failures.",
			"reasoning": "Similar to the Instagram task, this requires modifying existing code with proper error handling. The additional complexity comes from potential TikTok-specific video formats or encoding that might require special handling. The implementation needs to ensure compatibility with TikTok's audio tracks which often contain music or effects."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 20,
			"taskTitle": "Update API Response Schema",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the API response schema update into subtasks covering: 1) Pydantic model updates, 2) API documentation updates, and 3) Backward compatibility verification.",
			"reasoning": "This is a relatively straightforward task involving schema updates. The main considerations are maintaining backward compatibility and ensuring consistent documentation. The implementation details are clear and the changes are minimal, primarily adding an optional field to existing response models."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 21,
			"taskTitle": "Integration Testing and Performance Optimization",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the integration testing and performance optimization task into subtasks covering: 1) End-to-end test implementation, 2) Performance benchmarking, 3) Async processing implementation, 4) Timeout and fallback mechanisms, 5) Load testing, and 6) Memory usage optimization.",
			"reasoning": "This is the most complex task as it involves comprehensive testing across the entire system and performance optimization. It requires implementing asynchronous processing, timeout mechanisms, benchmarking, and load testing. The task also needs to address potential memory issues with large files and ensure system stability under high load."
